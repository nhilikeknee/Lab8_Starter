### Check your understanding
1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed
2. No
3. No. To fully test the "message" feature, you would need to test if the message could be written and sent by the sender and received by the recipient, which is application/feature level testing    
4. Yes. We are only testing one thing, the check would just be to check the length of the message, nothing else that requires another part of the application.
